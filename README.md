# The Last Coffee, For You
Sometimes you don't get a chance to say a proper goodbye..  
unfortunate as that fact is, in this game you're a dying child of a solo mother,  
please say goodbye to everyone..., please get closure..  
or not lel  
u can even avoid ur own mom for all i care  
(proper description when i feel like it, one exists on my github page actually)  

## Behind the Idea:
Shout out to me longing to reconnect w one of my old friends who posted a pic of her with my id lace  
you might not want to reconnect with me but you felt like a sister.. whatever the reason is, I'm sorry  

if im still in your mind, please reach out ðŸ‘‰ðŸ˜©ðŸ‘ˆ emz, jk thanks for the idea J****  

also to JJC for telling me 2 years ago to catch up on coffee, where's that at bruddah?  
and to all my friends who left me behind, let it not be the last time  

fuck u guys if we're actually done in our lifespan  
and to my father :>, stay alive~, see you in two years  

tf this turnt into a diary entry? 

OMG SHE REMEMBERS ME  (idc if she just shared a memory years agk, that's enough interaction for me)
