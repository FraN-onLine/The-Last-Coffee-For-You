# The Last Coffee, For You
You don't know when it'll be your last, will you say your goodbyes before it's too late  
reconnect with them before its too late  
or live with regret knowing that your last moment with them already passed away  
it's open and branching as it could be  
(proper description when i feel like it, one exists on my github page actually)  

## Behind the Idea:
Weirdly enough 3 people with REALLY similar names influenced the idea for this, the imminent doom and the feeling i won't see them again?  
regret, longing... things i could've done better  
As abandoned as i felt about them.. the more i yearned for recconection?  
Coffee in this game is a symbol of connection, Familial, Platonic or Romantic  

## The Coffee I Brewed for You: (regretful ahh song lyrics)  
  
One day, youll get tired of the tired of the coffee,  
Tired of the monotony of the same old story  
A latte with some toffee, A freshed cold brewed coffee~  
It's the same flavors you called "mine", a cup of some time?  
   
I'd like to think we'll collide one day,   
we'll share a coffee along the way,   
Oh I'll make a cup of ol' times for you,   
The memories we'll share once we're through   
It's the same flavors you called "mine", a cup of some time?  
will there be a next time....   
maybe it's our last... time...
